This version uses a legacy version of Stripe.

To make it work you need .env file that has API keys listed inside like:

STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=publickey

STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=secretkey

To make a test payment use a card number 4242 4242 4242 4242

Get your keys at https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/developers.

Don't forget to npm install )))) (stripe, express, dotenv, ejs)
